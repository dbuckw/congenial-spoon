                <h2>Who Is He?</h2>
                <p>Joel Embiid is a Cameroonian NBA center for the Philadelphia 76ers. Standing seven feet and two inches tall, he is not only physically a giant, but also a giant in the worlds of both basketball and social media, having made a name for himself as both one of the all-time most dominant big men in basketball history and something of a clown--or "Troel," as he would say--on Twitter and Instagram. His presence on the court and online is unmistakable.</p>

                    <h2>Joel "The Process" Embiid</h2>
                    <p>Joel Embiid is the five-time all-star, starting center for the Philadelphia 76ers.</p>

                <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
                <p>Born and raised in Cameroon, where the sport of basketball takes a back seat to likes of soccer, Joel had little contact with the game before the age of 15. His interest in the sport was first piqued watching Kobe Bryant and the Lakers in the 2010 NBA Finals--a player whom, despite playing a totally different position from Joel, Embiid would go on to imitate with great success. Joel was invited to a basketball camp directed by fellow Cameroonian NBA player, Luc mbah a Moute, who would "discover" the future star and encourage him to pursue a career in basketball.</p>
                <p>Joel abandoned his plan of pursuing volleyball as a means to get a scholarship and a college education, and moved to the U.S. to play high school basketball. He took to the sport slowly, starting out on the junior varsity team, and often felt discouraged, as he struggled with the fundamentals of the game. However, his combination of size and athleticism was not lost on anyone who saw him play, and by his senior year, he led his team to the state championship.</p>
                <p>During this time, Joel studied the post moves and footwork of fellow African, and Hall of Fame center, Hakeem Olajuwon, to whom Embiid now often draws comparisons. He also studied regular "white guys" on YouTube, whose shooting form he admired, and he developed his shooting stroke to become a threat from three-point range and nearly automatic in the midrange, as his shot has come to be compared to a not-so-average "white guy," named Dirk Nowitzki. While Joel's skills have drawn comparisons to great bigs and wings alike, while his physicality has been likened to Shaquille O'Neal's, Embiid has said--and proven--that his unprecedented combination of tools makes him uniquely Joel Embiid.</p>
                <p>Joel Embiid was "one-and-done" at the University of Kansas alongside Canadian phenom Andrew Wiggins, and he was named a finalist for the Naismith College Player of the Year. However, he suffered a stress fracture in his back and missed the Big 12 and NCAA tournaments. Because of this and lingering injury concerns, the projected number one pick fell to the Philadelphia 76ers at number three, selected by then-general manager Sam Hinkie.</p>
                <p>The 76ers under Hinkie were in the midst of what quickly came to be known as "the process,"--the often controversial era of 76ers management which prioritized the long-term value of players and assets over immediate successes. Detractors called "the process" tanking--or deliberately losing to get better draft picks, but in Philadelphia, the process has been largely vindicated, and "Trust the process" has become a popular refrain chanted at games, and Hinkie--who was eventually forced out is widely regarded by fans as a Christ-like martyr and folk hero.</p>
                <p>Embiid's part in the process was as difficult as any, as he would miss two full seasons before seeing any NBA playing time with a broken navicular bone in his foot. Analysts quickly labeled Embiid a bust and questioned if he would ever play an NBA game, and Embiid began to doubt himself, too. He was often criticized for his work ethic and fitness during this time, and he was popularly derided for his love of drinking Shirley Temples. During this time, he tragically lost his little brother in a car accident, and wanted to end his NBA career to go home and be with his family. Instead deciding to rededicate himself to the game, Joel would go on to establish himself as one of the most dominant players in the league, and came to consider himself the embodiment of "the process," even adopting the term as one of his many popular nicknames.</p>
